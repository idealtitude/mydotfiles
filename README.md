#### Notes

**(1)** Screencast made with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/ "asciinema website"), the best tool I know to do terminal screencast.
If you don't know it and want such a tool, take a look at the [Getting started](https://docs.asciinema.org/getting-started/ "asciinema getting started page") page; it's so easy to use, and it has many cool features.
